Work sample in 45m call with introductions & questions:

Interviewer seemed to suggest early to make it all quick answers.

- Brief intro yourself
- What are you looking for in your next job?
- What is your fav DB?
- What motivates you at work?

Coding tests expectations:
**NO CHATGPT, CoPilot, etc AI assisted tools.üö´
Google the docs OK.‚úÖ Webcam call & share entire screen.**

Interviewer confirmed interviewee should make quick progress for the example requirements instead of planning for future interface in this BankAccount class.

I referred to py unittest in DQValidator sev at Meta & made quick test plan for interviewer. He seemed to accept the test plan idea and suggested we skip exact implementation go to SQL questions to cover more ground.

Wins-
Python task seemed to be approved.
Interviewer noticed & agreed:
- Python
    - dictionary for currency repr - agreed good approach. 
- SQL
    - idea that "DOB" & user_id are missing in UPDATE SET age example.
    - RIGHT JOIN & coalesce in GROUP BY example is good approach.

Opportunities-
- Did not have SQL linter in call. Googled  UPDATE SET exact syntax and mentioned it is rare to use UPDATE SET in data warehouse.
- Shifting gears short session between introduction/questions/python/test/sql.
- Maybe spent too much time discussing stories/questions and less time coding.

I think overall it is a quick test of whether somebody can or cannot think about the problem space, discuss the example code requirements, pivot between Python, test cases, SQL ideas in a short 1|1.

I think it is a pass‚úÖ in a pass/fail early round surveyüìùüëÅ‚Äçüó®‚öñ. Success by being prepared, discussing the ideas and process, and perhaps some luck of the draw.
